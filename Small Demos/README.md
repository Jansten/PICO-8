# Small Demos

## Overview
- These are all small, very simple demos I wrote while learning the basics of PICO-8.  Will likely feature bad code, so it's not recommended to use as a tepmlate.

## Judy (Tutorial Game)
- Based on the tutorial at: https://thenewstack.io/retro-game-pico-8-basics/

## PinkCirc
- A pink circle that moves around the screen.
- Demo from the PICO-8 readme
